# Cheat List

## Install

Installation instructions for OS X and Linux

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcelocarlosbr/cheatsheets.git
cd cheatsheets
./install # or use ./install -l to create symbolic links instead of copying files
```

Note that if you change the script name (e.g. removing the .sh extension), you might have to adjust the contents of cheatsheets.bash to make it work.
